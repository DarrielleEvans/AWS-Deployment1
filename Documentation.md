I Downloaded files from Tyrone's Repository to my computer
I Created a new GitHub repository on my profile.
Tyrone's file contained files and folders. I could not drag the static and templates folder without changing its structure. 
Instead I had to clone my repository on my local computer and push the files and folders using Git commands.

I created an EC2 Instance using Ubuntu as my OS and downloaded Jenkins using terminal.
I created a new pipeline using my GitHub repository url. 
The build took 8 seconds and the testing stage took 586 milliseconds.

After the code was successfully built and tested, I uploaded a zip file containing the files from Github to AWS Beanstalk.
